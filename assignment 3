Q.1
Why are areas of the genome with high GC content hard to sequence?
Guanine and Cytosine have 3 hydrogen bonds linking them together whereas Adenine and Thymine are only linked together by two hydrogen bonds. During genome sequencing,  In the unwinding of the DNA helix, the 

Q.2
Best Global Alignment between the two following sequences:

Q.3

Q3.1
```{r}
bam.sam <- read.csv("single_cell_RNA_seq_bam.sam", nrows=73, sep="\t", header=FALSE,
fill=TRUE)
```
According to the SaM/Bam File: SN corresponds to the single base pair name and LN corresponds to the 

Q3.2: Length of the X chromosome
```{r}
print(bam.sam[22,"V3"]) 

```
ength of the X chromosome is 171031299 base pairs. We know it is row 22 because the X chromosome is the 22nd chromosome in the genome. 


Q4.1
```{r}
sam <- read.csv("single_cell_RNA_seq_bam.sam", sep="\t", header=FALSE,
comment.char="@", col.names = paste0("V",seq_len(30)), fill=TRUE)
sam <- sam[paste0("V",seq_len(11))]

```

Q4.2 Print 10th row of the data frame
```{r}
print(sam[10,])
```

The column which tells us how the read was aligned is V3, in this case the sequence was aligned with the reference sequence (1).

Q4.3 How many reads align to chromosome X
```{r}
length(which(sam$V3 == "X"))
```
5999 reads align with the X chromosome

Q4.4 What is the mean of base quality of alignments
```{r}
for (i in sam$V3){
  if(i == "X"){
    
  }
}
```

Q4.5 Plot patterns of base quality of reads as boxplot
```{r}

```
